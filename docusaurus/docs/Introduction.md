## What is Dyndle? 

Dyndle (short from Dynamic Delivery) is the new .Net development kit for websites powered by SDL Tridion Sites, built on top of the renowned [DD4T](https://dd4t.org/) framework. Dyndle is a product that is offered free-of-charge and developed open-source. [Trivident](https://trivident.com) is the company that manages pull request and releases, but anyone can contribute. [Trivident](https://trivident.com) can also arrange support for Dyndle as part of the professional services.

From an architecture point of view, Dyndle preserves one of the big benefits of DD4T: the fact that you own and control your web application. Dyndle adds many useful features to DD4T, but still leaves you in full control of your own web application.  

The Dyndle framework consists of multiple modules that provide different functionality. During implementation process, you can choose which modules to use, based on the requirements.
