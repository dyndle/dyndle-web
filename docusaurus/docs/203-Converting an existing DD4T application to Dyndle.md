Converting an existing DD4T web application to Dyndle is not hard. A Dyndle application is very similar to a DD4T application. Both are ASP.NET MVC web sites, with models, views and controllers. But Dyndle comes with much more out of the box. Depending on what you already built in your own application, you may or may not want to use these features. It's up to you.

The biggest change you will notice when migrating your DD4T application to Dyndle, is that Dyndle comes with a set of controllers to handle the retrieval and display of content from Tridion. Dyndle has a PageController for pages, an EntityController for component presentations, and a BinaryController for binaries.
