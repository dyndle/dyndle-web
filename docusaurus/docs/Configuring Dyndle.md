## Installing Dyndle without Quickstart

## Adding Dyndle to an existing implementation

### Quickstart

Dyndle offers a number of quickstart packages that lets you kickstart your Dyndle implementation by adding neccesary dependencies and providing all neccssary loading mechanisms.

Please note, that each Quickstart package assumes that you are using a certain Dependency Injection framework. Please select a package that reflects what you are using already, unless you want to switch DI framemwork at the same time as you add Dyndle.

### Manual 

Dyndle is a modular system that can be configured and loaded in any desired capacity. Please consult the above installation guide to properly install and configure the features you would like to include in your application.
